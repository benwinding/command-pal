## Benefit's of Command Palettes

- **Ease of use**
	- Simply 1 keyboard shortcut to remember
	- Fuzzy search allows you to find commands easily
- **Speed**
	- Keyboard makes it fast to access any command/function
	- Fuzzy search allows for quick ordering of commands
	- Efficient to find a commands that you used once a long time ago
- **Discoverability**

## Why?

_Command Palettes_ have alwyas impressed me with how easy they are to use and develop for. I rarely see them on the web platform, so I thought I'd give it a shot.

## Get Started

### Install

Either install from npm

`yarn add command-pal`

Or use the script tag

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/command-pal"></script>
```

### Usage - Simple

``` js
const c = new CommandPal({
  hotkey: "ctrl+space",
  commands: [
    {
      name: "Send Message",
      shortcut: "ctrl+m",
      handler: () => alert("Send Message"),
    },
    {
      name: "Search Contacts",
      handler: () => alert("Searching contacts..."),
    },
    {
      name: "Goto Profile",
      shortcut: "ctrl+4",
      handler: () => window.location.hash = "profile",
    },
  ],
});
c.start();
```

### Usage - Advanced

``` js
const c = new CommandPal({
  hotkey: "ctrl+space",
  placeholder: "Custom placeholder text...",
  commands: [
    {
      name: "Change Language",
      children: [
        {
          name: "English",
          handler: () => alert("Changing to English")
        },
        {
          name: "Spanglish",
          handler: () => alert("Changing to Spanglish")
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Goto About",
      handler: () => window.location.hash = "about",
    },
  ],
});
c.start();
```

## API

### CommandPal instance
``` js
const c = new CommandPal({
  hotkey: "ctrl+space",  // Launcher shortcut
  hotkeysGlobal: true,       // Makes shortcut keys work in any <textarea>, <input> or <select>
  id: "CommandPal", // adds unique ID to aid in targeting with CSS
  placeholder: "Custom placeholder text...", //  Changes placeholder text of input
  debugOuput: false, // if true report debugging info to console
  hideButton: false, // if true, do not generate mobile button
  commands: [
    // Commands go here
  ]
});
// Start the instance
c.start()
// Destroy the instance
c.destroy()
```

### Subscribe to events
There's a few events that can be subscribed to during command-pal's execution.

``` js
// When a command is executed
c.subscribe("exec", (e) => { console.log("exec", { e }); });
// On TextChanged
c.subscribe("textChanged", (e) => { console.log("textChanged", { e }); });
// When a command palette is opened
c.subscribe("opened", (e) => { console.log("opened", { e }); });
// When a command palette is closed
c.subscribe("closed", (e) => { console.log("closed", { e }); });
```

### Command Item

``` js
{
  // Required name of command (displayed)
  name: "Open Messages",
  // Required name of command (displayed)
  description: "View all messages in inbox",
  // Shortcut of command
  shortcut: "ctrl+3",
  // Callback function of the command to execute
  handler: (e) => {
    // DO SOMETHING
  }
  // Child commands which can be executed
  children: [...]
},
```

### Command Item Child

Note: Child commands cannot have shortcuts.

``` js
{
  // Required name of command (displayed)
  name: "Open Messages",
  // Required name of command (displayed)
  description: "View all messages in inbox",
  // Callback function of the command to execute
  handler: (e) => {
    // DO SOMETHING
  }
},
```

### Add/Remove Command's At Runtime

The command list is an observed array, which means you can modify it even after it's instantiated. The following snippet shows how commands can be dynamically added during runtime.

``` js
const commands = [
  {
    name: "Add Command to List",
    handler: () => {
      commands.push({
        name: 'New Command',
        handler: () => {
          // Do something
        },
      });
    },
  },
];
const c = new CommandPal({
  hotkey: "ctrl+space",
  commands: commands,
});
c.start();
```

### Styling CommandPal instances

The styles used by command-pal are included in the package. However you can override the default CSS using the following.

```css
  /* mobile button */
  #CommandPal .mobile-button  { top: 30px; }
  /* modal background */
  #CommandPal .modal-mask { background-color: rgb(0,128,200,0.75); }
  /* item background */
  #CommandPal [slot=items] { background-color: yellow;}
  /* item text */
  #CommandPal .item { color:black; }
```

You can also assign a custom `id` to the CommandPal instance.

```js
   c = CommandPal(..., id: 'mypal',)
```

Which allows you to style a specific instance.

```css
  /* mobile button for CommandPal with id='mypal' */
  #mypal .mobile-button  { top: 30px; bottom: auto;}
```

## Local Development

To develop on `command-pal` simply clone, install and run

```
npm run dev
```
Then the following link:

### Prevent Blur

When the search input loses focus (receives a blur event), the palette
closes. This makes inspecting the palette using the browser's DevTools
difficult, as switching to DevTools causes the focus to be lost. It is
possible to stop the palette from closing when focus is lost.

``` js
// Disable palette from closing during testing
window.commandPalIgnoreBlur = true;
// Re-enable
window.commandPalIgnoreBlur = false;
```

Have a go, PR's and issues always welcome.

## Prior Art
Many applications have implemented this before, here's a few. My favourite implementation is the VScode, which is the main influence for this project.

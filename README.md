## Benefit's of Command Palettes

- **Ease of use**
	- Simply 1 keyboard shortcut to remember
	- Fuzzy search allows you to find commands easily
- **Speed**
	- Keyboard makes it fast to access any command/function
	- Fuzzy search allows for quick ordering of commands
	- Efficient to find a commands that you used once a long time ago
- **Discoverability**
	- You can scroll down the entire list of commands

## Why?

_Command Palettes_ have alwyas impressed me with how easy they are to use and develop for. I rarely see them on the web platform, so I thought I'd give it a shot.

## Get Started

### Install

Either install from npm

`yarn add command-pal`

Or use the script tag

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/command-pal"></script>
```

### Usage - Simple

``` js
const c = new CommandPal({
  hotkey: "ctrl+space",
  commands: [
    {
      name: "Send Message",
      shortcut: "ctrl+m",
      handler: () => alert("Send Message"),
    },
    {
      name: "Search Contacts",
      handler: () => alert("Searching contacts..."),
    },
    {
      name: "Goto Profile",
      shortcut: "ctrl+4",
      handler: () => window.location.hash = "profile",
    },
  ],
});
c.start();
```

### Usage - Avanced

``` js
const c = new CommandPal({
  hotkey: "ctrl+space",
  placeholder: "Custom placeholder text...",
  commands: [
    {
      name: "Change Language",
      children: [
        {
          name: "English",
          handler: () => alert("Changing to English")
        },
        {
          name: "Spanglish",
          handler: () => alert("Changing to Spanglish")
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Goto About",
      handler: () => window.location.hash = "about",
    },
  ],
});
c.start();
```

## API

### CommandPal instance
``` js
const c = new CommandPal({
  hotkey: "ctrl+space",  // Launcher shortcut
  hotkeysGlobal: true,       // Makes shortcut keys work in any <textarea>, <input> or <select>
  paletteId: "CommandPalette", // adds unique ID to aid in targeting with CSS
  placeholder: "Custom placeholder text...", //  Changes placeholder text of input
  commands: [
    // Commands go here
  ]
});
// Start the instance
c.start()
// Destroy the instance
c.destroy()
```

### Subscribe to events
There's a few events that can be subscribed to during command-pal's execution.

``` js
// When a command is executed
c.subscribe("exec", (e) => { console.log("exec", { e }); });
// On TextChanged
c.subscribe("textChanged", (e) => { console.log("textChanged", { e }); });
// When a command palette is opened
c.subscribe("opened", (e) => { console.log("opened", { e }); });
// When a command palette is closed
c.subscribe("closed", (e) => { console.log("closed", { e }); });
```

### Command Item

``` js
{
  // Required name of command (displayed)
  name: "Open Messages",
  // Required name of command (displayed)
  description: "View all messages in inbox",
  // Shortcut of command
  shortcut: "ctrl+3",
  // Callback function of the command to execute
  handler: (e) => {
    // DO SOMETHING
  }
  // Child commands which can be executed
  children: [...]
},
```

### Command Item Child

Note: Child commands cannot have shortcuts.

``` js
{
  // Required name of command (displayed)
  name: "Open Messages",
  // Required name of command (displayed)
  description: "View all messages in inbox",
  // Callback function of the command to execute
  handler: (e) => {
    // DO SOMETHING
  }
},
```

### Add/Remove Command's At Runtime

The command list is an observed array, which means you can modify it even after it's instantiated. The following snippet shows how commands can be dynamically added during runtime.

``` js
const commands = [
  {
    name: "Add Command to List",
    handler: () => {
      commands.push({
        name: 'New Command',
        handler: () => {
          // Do something
        },
      });
    },
  },
];
const c = new CommandPal({
  hotkey: "ctrl+space",
  commands: commands,
});
c.start();
```

### Styling CommandPal instances

The styles used by command-pal are included in the package, but you
can override these. To make this easier, command-pal adds HTML id's to
a few components.

   * The whole palette is identified by `CommandPalette`.
   * The mobile button inside `#CommandPalette` is identified by
     `CommandPalette-button`.
   * Lastly the mask/backdrop for the palette inside `#CommandPalette`
     is identified by `CommandPalette-mask`.
     
The `CommandPalette` part of the id's can be set using the `paletteId`
option to `CommandPal()`.

Using this you can assign different backgrounds to different instances
of command-pal. For example:
```css
  #mypal-button { top: 30px; bottom: auto;} 
  #mypal-mask { background-color: rgb(255,255,0,0.75); }
  #mypal [slot=items] { background-color: red}
```
along with:
```
   c = CommandPal(..., paletteId: 'mypal',)
```

will result in:

   * the mobile button for the palette will be moved 30 pixels from
     the top rather than 10px from the bottom.
   * the backdrop will be yellow at 75% opacity rather than
     black at 50% opacity.
   * the background for the unselected/unhovered items on the command
     list will be red.

The `-button` and `-mask` ids are a shortcut. This is also valid:
```css
  /* mypal-button */
  #mypal > button  { top: 30px; bottom: auto;}
  /* mypal-mask */
  #mypal > div.modal-mask { background-color: rgb(0,128,200,0.75); }
  #mypal [slot=items] { background-color: yellow;}
  #mypal .item {color:black;} /* color of text against yellow background */
```
but is more difficult to use and depends on the structure of the HTML
more than using ids.

## Local Development

To develop on `command-pal` simply clone, install and run

```
npm run dev
```
Then the following link:

Have a go, PR's and issues always welcome.

## Prior Art
Many applications have implemented this before, here's a few. My favourite implementation is the VScode, which is the main influence for this project.
